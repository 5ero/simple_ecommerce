Simple ecommerce site using  Tailwind + Laravel + Livewire.

Uses stripe for payments and sendinblue for mail notifications.
Copy .env-example to .env

php artisan migrate --seed

/login for admin

email: dev@example.com
pass: password

This is in no way a "Complete solution" and is just a way for me to play around with Livewire (which I think is great by the way!).

You can run php artisan test after install

Software here is licenced as "use at your peril"

use it,
bin it,
kill it

Have fun!
